#  AML Transaction Monitoring & Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) Project

This two-part project simulates a real-world Anti-Money Laundering (AML) investigation using a dataset of 10,000 financial transactions. It demonstrates both data-driven transaction monitoring and manual escalation through an Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) report.

**Objective:**  
Visualize and monitor suspicious transactions to identify high-risk clients based on red flags such as shell companies, tax havens, transaction size, and source of funds.

**Tool Used:** Power BI  
**Key Features:**
- KPI Cards: Total Transactions, High-Risk Volume, STR Filing Rate, Avg Transaction Amount
- Donut Chart: Source of Money Breakdown (Legal vs Illegal)
- Matrix Heatmap: Risk Score vs Shell Company Count
- Country-wise Transaction Risk Distribution

- Tax Haven Destination Visualization
- Interactivity via filters (Country, Risk Category, Transaction Type)
